<h2>Intro</h2>

If you already know me from <a title="Twitter Christoph Rumpel" href="https://twitter.com/christophrumpel">Twitter</a>, then you probably have noticed that I am a big fan of the PHP framework Laravel by Taylor Otwell.<br />
A year ago I wanted to learn Ruby because I wasn’t satisfied with PHP anymore and I thought it was time to check out a new language. After two weeks of fun while diving into Ruby and Ruby on Rails I started a new job and I head to deal with PHP again =) Some friends told me to take a look at Laravel and that’s what I did. I immediately fall in love with this awesome framework and since that it is my PHP framework of choice.
<h2>Why Laravel</h2>

<blockquote>There are many ORM solutions out there, but none as Eloquent as… well Eloquent (Dayle Rees)</blockquote>

There are so many reasons that I could fill the whole article with information about that. Additionally I don’t want to write the same stuff here that you will find in so many other articles out there about Laravel. But just to be on the safe side, I will mention some main features.
`Migration` - A great version control system for you database schema like you might know from Ruby on Rails. I just wouldn’t want to work without such a system anymore.
<span class="font-bold">Composer</span> - Laravel is using composer,  a php dependency manager,  to install and update its dependencies. Besides it used to include third-party packages to your application. It has never been easier to manage your code.
<span class="font-bold">Artisan</span> - Is the name of the Laravel command-line interface, which provides dozens of commands for your daily application work. This is one of my favourite features, because it makes working with Laravel super fast.
<span class="font-bold">Eloquent</span> - This is the ORM solution which lets you interact with your database through PHP objects. This is damn powerful and easy to use.
<span class="font-bold">Testing</span> - Laravel is built with testing in mind and  testing with PHPUnit is already included. How cool is that right?
And there is a lot more!
