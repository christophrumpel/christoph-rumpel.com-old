Do you hate to write fully qualified class names in strings too? Have you ever seen PHP frameworks use the ::class keyword and wondered what it does and where it comes from? Let's find out how these two things fit together!

## The class keyword

Since PHP 5.5 the class keyword is used for class name resolution. This means it `returns the fully qualified 
ClassName`. This is extremely useful when you have namespaces, because the namespace is part of the returned name. Here 
are two examples showing the returned string with a namespaced class and without.

 <div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> PHP 5.5 sounds old. Yes, but still a lot of people don't know about it.</div>

```php
<?php

class User {

}

echo User::class; // returns User

```

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

class User {

}

echo User::class; // returns App\Models\User

```

## Real application examples

Alright, this is what it does. But how and when do I need this? In fact there are quite some occasions. When you search 
for the keyword in the Laravel framework, you will over a hundred results! Seems that it is useful indeed.

But you can make use of it too. Let's take a look at a relationship in a Laravel model.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Phone extends Model
{
    /**
     * Get the user that owns the phone.
     */
    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo('App\Models\User');
    }
}

```

Here we need to provide the related class name for the belongsTo method. Already thinking the same? Yes, we can use the 
keyword here too.

```php
<?php


return $this->belongsTo(User::class);


```

This way we gain two benefits. First we have to write less. Secondly, since we don't write a string our IDE can help us 
find the right class and import the class. Below is a GIF showing the difference in PhpStorm.

## Conclusion

Two things to remember from this article. First, `use the class keyword`. Your workflow will benefit from it. Secondly, if
 you see something in a framework you don't quite understand, `try to find it out`. Take some time and dig into your 
 framework, project or just programming language. You will benefit from understanding these details too.
