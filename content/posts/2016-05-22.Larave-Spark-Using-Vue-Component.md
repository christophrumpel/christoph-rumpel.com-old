title: "Laravel Spark - Vue components"
summary: "Laravel Spark is out and it is really exciting to work with. But it is different from building an application from scratch. It provides a lot of great features but this also means quite some new stuff to learn. Today I want to 
show you how to use a Vue component in Spark."

## Laravel and Vue

Vue.js is a lightweight modern JavaScript framework that is very popular these days. Especially when you do not want the 
overhead of frameworks like Angular or React, Vue is a great choice. Additionally it is great when you do not 
need a whole SPA (Single page application). Just use your Vue components where you want them.

<blockquote>Components are one of the most powerful features of Vue.js. They help you extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code.(Vuejs.org)</blockquote>

Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel, is a big Vue fan and this is why you will find it in a lot of Laravel products.
Spark is using Vue too. A lot of the given features like the authentication, the admin panel or the menu is 
build with Vue. But it is not a requirement. Of course you can use the front-end framework of your choice, but I can 
totally recommend it.

## Spark and Vue components

This is how a Vue component is created.

```javascript
var MyComponent = Vue.extend({
  // options...
})
```
This is the JS part. Additionally you will need some markup for your component which you can add through the template 
property.
 
 ```javascript
 // Define a vue component
 var MyComponent = Vue.extend({
   template: '<div>A custom component!</div>'
 })
 ```
 
 One way to define your markup is to add it inside your component. To use this component you would just use custom tags 
 like:
 
  ```html
 // Inside your HTML
 <my-component inline-template></my-component>
  ```
 
 I do not like this approach, because a string is not the best way to store HTML markup. Therefor I prefer the inline template feature of Vue. Here we have a custom tag for my component with an HTML attribute of `inline-template`. This tells Vue to use the markup inside of these tags. This is much cleaner and your IDE will recognise it.
 
 ```html
 // Inside your HTML
 <my-component inline-template>
   These are compiled as the component's own template
   Not parent's transclusion content.
 </my-component>
 ```
 
 In both cases you will need to write you component styles in your CSS files like always. This is a little disadvantage 
 because your component has parts in multiple locations. It would be much better if all the parts where just in one file.


## Vueify to rescue
Vueify lets you write all your component stuff in one file like this:

```html
// myComponent.vue
<style>
  .red {
    color: #f00;
  }
</style>

<template>
  <h1 class="red">{{ "{{ msg " }}}}</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Hello world!'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
  
Isn't that great? Every time you want to change something in your component there is only one place you need to look.

## Back to Spark

When I started to use Spark I wanted to use some of my already given .vue components too, but since Spark is a little 
bit different from standard Laravel projects I didn't managed to use them. After some weeks of reaching out for help, I 
finally got the solution. (Big thx to [@jstoone](https://twitter.com/jstoone))

Here is an example of a .vue component. It just outputs a headline with a certain message. This will be our example .vue
 file.

```html
<template>
    <h1 class="helloMessage">{{ "{{ message " }}}}</h1>
</template>

<script>
    export default {
        props: {},

        data() {
            return {
                message: "Hello .vue component"
            }
        },

        ready() {}

    }
</script>

<style>
    .helloMessage {
        font-size: 32px;
        color: #ac050b;
        margin: 30px 0;
        text-align: center;
    }
</style>
```

### 1. Adding a global .vue component

First we want to register this component as a global one. Therefore you need to modify your Spark's app.js:

```javascript
// resources/js/app.js
require('spark-bootstrap');

require('./components/bootstrap');

import Hello from './components/Hello.vue'; // (new)

Vue.component('hello', Hello); // (new)

var app = new Vue({
    mixins: [require('spark')],
});
```

Just the two lines marked with "new" are, well guess, new.

Let's test it by placing the component inside the home.blade.php view.

```html
@section('content')
<hello></hello>
<home :user="user" inline-template>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Application Dashboard -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                <div class="panel panel-default">
                    <div class="panel-heading">Dashboard</div>
                    <div class="panel-body">
                        Your application's dashboard.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</home>
@endsection
```

Let's check if everything is working. Wuhu!

### 2. Adding a child component

If you want to use a component inside of another component like the Spark home component, you can do that as well. 

```javascript
// resources/js/app.js
require('spark-bootstrap');

require('./components/bootstrap');

import Hello from './components/Hello.vue';

Vue.component('home', {
    components: {
        Hello
    },
    props: ['user'],

    ready() {
        //
    }
});

var app = new Vue({
    mixins: [require('spark')],
});
```

We are importing the .vue component again, but then we add it to a already existing component. Now we can use Hello inside of the home component:


```html
@extends('spark::layouts.app')

@section('content')
<home :user="user" inline-template>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Application Dashboard -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                <hello></hello>
                <div class="panel panel-default">
                    <div class="panel-heading">Dashboard</div>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        Your application's dashboard.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</home>
@endsection
```

## Conclusion

Last time I showed how to start [adding a little nav in Laravel Spark](/2016/05/Larave-Spark-Adding-a-navigation). Today it was all about Vue components. Not everybody is a fan of the one file .vue components, but if you are you now know how to use them in your Laravel 
Spark application. Thx to @jstoone again for providing the solutions!
