## The perfect entry point

To make your first chatbot experience a good one, I built a boilerplate for working in PHP. It includes everything you need to know to connect your application to a messenger platform. You will find simple examples to reply to chat messages in different ways.

Additionally this boilerplate support the NLP platform Dialogflow. This will help you to process and understand the user's intent.

 <div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> Currently only Facebook Messenger is supported.</div>

## Installation

### Create a FB page

First login to Facebook and [create a Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create). The page doesn't need to be public. Choose the settings that fit best your bot, but for testing, it is not essential.

### Create an FB Messenger app

Go to the [developer's app page](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). Click "Add a New App" and fill the basic app fields.

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing how to create FB app" src="/images/blog/chatbot_create_fb_app.png" />

On the "Product Setup" page choose Messenger and click "Get Started."

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing Facebook app product" src="/images/blog/chatbot_create_fb_app_setup.png" />

Now we need to create a token to give our app access to our Facebook page. Select the created page, grant permissions and copy the generated token. We need that one later.

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing Facebook app token creation" src="/images/blog/chatbot_fb_app_create_page_token.png" />

### Setup the Chatbot PHP Boilerplate

First, clone the repository and remove the existing git folder.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:christophrumpel/chatbot-php-boilerplate.git chatbot-boilerplate
```

```bash
cd chatbot-boilerplate
rm -rf .git
```

Now we need to install the Composer dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

 <div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on how Composer is installed on your system / project the command 
 may look different.
 </div>

This boilerplate is working with a `.env` file (environment). All sensible data like keys are stored there. This file 
should be listed in your `.gitignore` file. This is because this data should not be included in your repository. 
Additionally, you can use different keys in different environments. (e.g., test bot platform account on your local
 environment)
 
In this boilerplate there is an example file included called `.env.example.` Rename it to use it.

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

Next, take a look at this file. Here we have two values to consider for now. First one is the `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` which is a token you can define yourself here. Fill something in now; we will need it later. The second value is the `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` which we already got from our messenger app. Fill it in here. Perfect!

## Create a webhook for the messenger app

On our PHP application, we need to have a webhook. This means a public URL that Facebook can talk to. Every time the user writes a message inside the FB chat, FB will send it to this URL which is the entrance point to our PHP application. In this boilerplate, it is the index.php file.

So we need a public URL to the index.php file, and there are two options here for you.

### Make it live

If you got a server, you could push your code there where you have public access to it. The URL then maybe looks like `https://yourserver.com/chatbot-php-boilerplate/.`

### Do it locally

For testing, it is easier when you don't have to push every change to a live server to test the code. 
This is why I use a local public URL. There are multiple services out there that generate a public URL to your local server. Checkout out [ngrok](https://www.sitepoint.com/use-ngrok-test-local-site/) or use [Laravel Valet Sharing](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/valet#sharing-sites) which is my choice since I'm using Valet already. (Laravel Valet is using  ngrok under the hood too)

It doesn't matter how you do it, but you just need a secured public URL to the `index.php` file. (https!). This is my URL: `https://7def2gH4.ngrok.io`

### Connect the Facebook app to your application

Now that we got the URL we need to setup the webhook. Go back to your Facebook app settings and click `Setup Webhooks` 
inside the Webhooks part.

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing Facebook app webhook setup" src="/images/blog/chatbot_fb_app_setup_webhook.png" />

Fill in in the public URL, the `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` from the `.env` file, check all the subscription fields and click 
`Verify and Save.`


<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing Facebook app webhook info" src="/images/blog/chatbot_fb_app_setup_webhook_info.png" />

If you did everything right, you have a working webhook now. If not you will see an error icon in the webhook URL field. This happens if the URL or the token is not correct.

### Connect the Facebook app to the Facebook page

Now the last step of the installation will make sure that our Facebook app is connected to the Facebook page. For this purpose, there is a drop-down within your `Webhooks` setting page. Choose your page here and click `Subscribe.` 

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing Facebook App Page Subscription" src="/images/blog/chatbot_webhook_page_selection.png" />


### Test it

So finally we can test the whole setup. Go to your Facebook page and click the message button to send a message. Type `Hi` and press enter. You should now see this answer: `Define your own logic to reply to this message: Hi`

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing chatbot first response" src="/images/blog/chatbot_response.png" />

If you see this, then congratulations. You did it! You have successfully installed the Chatbot PHP Boilerplate and received your first reply.

If you don't get a reply, then something went wrong =( Check your server's log files to find out more. Additionally, you can use the built-in Monolog Logger to debug the applications.


## Usage

### Example 1: Static message

In your `index.php` file you will find this line of code:

```php
$replyMessage = $chatbotHelper->getAnswer($message);
```

Here the user's message is being used to get an answer. In this case, the message is analyzed in the `ChatbotAi method getAnswer.` It is simply returning a static text with the original message. Like mentioned below, you can define your own logic to respond to the message. It is also common to use PHP's `preg_match` function to look for words inside the message. In the example, the method returns some hello text, if the message contains `hi,` `hey` or `hello.`

### Example 2: Foreign Exchange Rates

Here a public API is used to return foreign exchange rates to the user. The user can type currencies like `EUR`, `USD`, 
`CHF` etc. It is a simple example but good to see how to work with external APIs. To make it work, comment out the first example and uncomment the second.

```php
// Example 1: Get a static message back
//$replyMessage = $chatbotHelper->getAnswer($message);

// Example 2: Get foreign exchange rates
$replyMessage = $chatbotHelper->getAnswer($message, 'rates');
```

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing rates example bot" src="/images/blog/chatbot_rates_example.png" />

### Example 3: Using Dialogflow

NLP platforms can help you analyze the user's intent of a message; we can use them as a service where we send the user's message to.

To use Dialog flow you just need to add the parameter `dialogflow` to the `getAnswer` method. There is also an example in your `index
.php` 
file.

```php
// Don't forget to provide your Dialogflow token in the .env file
$replyMessage = $chatbotHelper->getAnswer($message, 'dialogflow');
```

Besides that, you also need to set up an intent in Dialogflow. I won't cover that in this tutorial, but I will show you a screenshot of the one that I use for this example.

<img class="blogimage" alt="Dialogflow Intent Example" src="/images/blog/dialogflow_example.png" />

When you now type something like `I want to learn English` or `What about we learn Spanish today` Dialogflow will match the intent and send back the prepared answer which is `Great, let's start with $language.` So it will also automatically detect the language the user said.
<br /><br />
UPDATE: It is now also possible to make use of DialogFlow's `payload responses.` If you want to reply custom Facebook payloads right from DialogFlow, then this is what you need. But it only works, when there is no text response added to the intent. Check out [the changes](https://github.com/christophrumpel/chatbot-php-boilerplate/commit/b058755d428533c22458d252819ae87ccbcf4c6e) for more details.

### Example 4: Using wit.ai

The former story feature from wit.ai has been [deprecated](https://wit.ai/blog/2017/07/27/sunsetting-stories).
Right now I wouldn't recommend using wit.ai, and this is why I removed that part of the article and the code.

## Conclusion

You should now have a simple chatbot and a perfect setup for building your own. Try to implement your logic now to respond to the user's messages. This repo should be a place where you can try this stuff out.
