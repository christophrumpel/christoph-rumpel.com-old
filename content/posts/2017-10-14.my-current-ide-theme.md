title: "My current IDE theme"
summary: "I am a visual person. I like it when things are not only useful but beautiful too. Sames goes for my IDE. Since I use it most of my day I want it to look amazing. Once in a while I need to change my current theme to give my eyes a fresh start. This is what my new current theme looks like."

## The result

Let's start with the result here. This is what my current PhpStorm Theme looks like. Of course you can get similar results for other IDEs too, but I only trust PhpStorm :-)

## The theme

The theme I use is called [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) and is a very popular theme these days. You can use for most of IDEs out there and other applications. There is a certain site explaining how to use it for [JetBrains products](https://draculatheme.com/jetbrains/). I am a big fan of dark themes and I don't use light ones anymore. It feels much more comfortable for my eyes.

## The font

Next to the colors, the font is really important for every IDE. I always wanted to use [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator). It is the most beautiful code font out there, but it is really expensive. (starts with â‚¬199) So I was looking for a similar one which is a bit cheaper. I don't have a problem with paying for stuff, but for a font I'm not willing to pay that much. Luckily I found [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). This is the best free coding font I found. 

<blockquote>Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations.</blockquote>

This is why we have these new beautiful symbols which are much easier to process for our eyes. You just write the normal characters like "==" or ">=" but what you get is a ligature.

I also like to have little bigger font size and line height. This is a screenshot of the font settings I use. Make sure to enable ligatures to use the mentioned symbols.

## The terminal

Like seen in the screenhots I am using the PhpStorm built-in terminal. The colors used are the ones from the Dracula theme as well.

But behind the colors I am still using the [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) theme [agnoster](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#agnoster). It has a nice prompt.

Here is another screenshot showing the nice little prompt details.

## Conclusion

This is what my new theme looks like and I really love it. I also want to keep my PhpStorm look as minimal as possible because that's what I liked about Sublime Text before. For me this is now a perfection combination of a useful and beautiful IDE. Let me know about your themes too.
