title: GroupBy multiple levels in Laravel
categories: Laravel
summary: Since Laravel v5.5.29 you can group collections by multiple levels. Let's see what this means and how this works.

## Arrange

So this article is about a new feature in Laravel. But before we check that out, let's see how it worked before. `groupBy` is a method of the Collection class. For our examples I will create some data to work with. Students will be a factory state of the given User class.

```php
// Default user factory which comes with Laravel
$factory->define(App\User::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'name' => $faker->name,
        'email' => $faker->unique()->safeEmail,
        'password' => '$2y$10$TKh8H1.PfQx37YgCzwiKb.KjNyWgaHb9cbcoQgdIVFlYg7B77UdFm', // secret
        'remember_token' => str_random(10),
    ];
});

// Our new students state
$factory->state(App\User::class, 'students', function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'skilllevel' => collect(['beginner', 'intermediate', 'professional'])->random(),
        'teacher' => collect(['Peter', 'Markus', 'Chris'])->random(),
    ];
});
```

This new state will add some data to the users. We have a new skilllevel and a teacher value. For our examples we will use a simple route callback. This way we can easily return the result in the browser.

```php
Route::get('/', function () {

    return $students = factory(User::class)
        ->times(3)
        ->states('students')
        ->make();

});
```
<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> We use the make method instead of the create method, because we have no database set up.</div>

This will produce our test data which looks something like this:

```json
[
	{
		"name": "Jakayla Leffler",
		"email": "ocie70@example.com",
		"skilllevel": "professional",
		"teacher": "Peter"
	},
	{
		"name": "Gustave Cummings II",
		"email": "crona.alexandrea@example.net",
		"skilllevel": "intermediate",
		"teacher": "Markus"
	},
	{
		"name": "Ms. Ethelyn Bergnaum MD",
		"email": "deckow.kelvin@example.net",
		"skilllevel": "beginner",
		"teacher": "Peter"
	}
]
```

## Basic example

I said `something like` because we are using the Faker package in our factory. So every result will look different. Next we use the `groupBy` method, to group our data by the skilllevel.

```php
return $students->groupBy('skilllevel');
```

You will see the new keys for the skilllevel in our result.

```json
{
	"professional": [
		{
			"name": "Jacquelyn Kilback",
			"email": "christopher55@example.net",
			"skilllevel": "professional",
			"teacher": "Chris"
		}
	],
	"beginner": [
		{
			"name": "Miss Ophelia Ryan Jr.",
			"email": "pollich.tristin@example.net",
			"skilllevel": "beginner",
			"teacher": "Chris"
		},
		{
			"name": "Furman Hahn",
			"email": "blowe@example.net",
			"skilllevel": "beginner",
			"teacher": "Markus"
		}
	]
}
```

## Finally some new stuff

Till here, nothing is really new. So what is the new feature I was talking about? Patrizio T. made a [pull request](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/22630) so that you're able to group collections by multiple levels. Let's take a look at an example for a better understanding of what that means.

```php
return $students->groupBy(['skilllevel','teacher']);
```

We are passing an array instead of a string to define multiple levels. First the students should be grouped by the skilllevel and then by the teacher. So this is what we get:

```json
{
	"intermediate": {
		"Peter": [
			{
				"name": "Jana McClure III",
				"email": "oliver.pagac@example.com",
				"skilllevel": "intermediate",
				"teacher": "Peter"
			}
		],
		"Chris": [
			{
				"name": "Rosemarie Barrows",
				"email": "epurdy@example.com",
				"skilllevel": "intermediate",
				"teacher": "Chris"
			}
		]
	},
	"professional": {
		"Markus": [
			{
				"name": "Katrine Streich",
				"email": "carlee.koepp@example.com",
				"skilllevel": "professional",
				"teacher": "Markus"
			}
		]
	}
}
```
This grouping can be helpful when you want to display or compare the data. In this case only Markus has a professional student. Maybe he is already a better teacher? 

## Going crazy

It wouldn't make sense for our case but we could group the students by their name and email as well.

```php
return $students->groupBy(['skilllevel','teacher', 'name', 'email']);
```

This is some crazy nested structure, but it is possible :-)

```json
{
	"professional": {
		"Peter": {
			"Mrs. Ella McClure": {
				"forest.bernier@example.com": [
					{
						"name": "Mrs. Ella McClure",
						"email": "forest.bernier@example.com",
						"skilllevel": "professional",
						"teacher": "Peter"
					}
				]
			}
		},
		"Chris": {
			"Miss Assunta Predovic PhD": {
				"amari.klocko@example.com": [
					{
						"name": "Miss Assunta Predovic PhD",
						"email": "amari.klocko@example.com",
						"skilllevel": "professional",
						"teacher": "Chris"
					}
				]
			}
		}
	},
	"intermediate": {
		"Markus": {
			"Keshawn Crona DVM": {
				"vkilback@example.org": [
					{
						"name": "Keshawn Crona DVM",
						"email": "vkilback@example.org",
						"skilllevel": "intermediate",
						"teacher": "Markus"
					}
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Conclusion

I really like how simple it is now to group a collection by multiple values. The syntax is straight forward and it works really well. Do you got other good examples for this new feature? Let me know about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christophrumpel).
