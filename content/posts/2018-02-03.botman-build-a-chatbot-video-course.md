## The course

The [video course](https://buildachatbot.io) right now consists of 41 videos which are about 3,5 hours in length. Marcel explains everything you need to know to build a chatbot with his library called [BotMan](https://botman.io). And I can tell you, this is the best chatbot library for PHP out there.
<br /><br />
He walks you through from listening to simple commands to more complex stuff like conversations and natural language processing or middlewares. You will also build a nice todo-bot on Telegram together. Every video is about three to ten minutes long which makes them easy to watch and follow. The regular price will be $249 but with the early access program `you can get the course for just $139`. 

## The playground

Besides the course Marcel also created a product called `BotMan Playground`. Now this is really interesting.
You can create an account there and start writing BotMan code inside your browser. No need to setup a local environment for testing out new stuff. It all works in the browser. You can also connect your code to a messenger like Facebook or Telegram. This makes it super useful to test out new stuff or to share code. The latter I will use a lot. Actually every video from the course has a dedicated code snippet in BotMan Playground where you can test it out yourself.
<br><br>
Best thing about it: BotMan Playground is included in the video course. So you get both products together. 


## The creator(s)

I guess most people know [Marcel Pociot](https://twitter.com/marcelpociot) already. He has been an active PHP / Laravel community member now for years and has built multiple packages or contributed to projects. The last years he was working on BotMan besides his full-time job. BotMan gave him the chance to quit this job and start a company with his friend [Sebastian Schlein](https://twitter.com/seb_sebsn) called [Beyond Code](https://beyondco.de/).

## Conclusion
I am really glad that they are able now to work each day on BotMan and provide more and more features. So please check out the course, learn a ton of stuff and help your favourite chatbot library to grow at the same time. I am already looking forward to the next videos, because Marcel is planning to release about 2 hours of more videos which will be included as well.
