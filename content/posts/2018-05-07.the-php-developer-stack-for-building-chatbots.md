## The Abstract

Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, Skype, and Telegram have more than three billion active users combined! This led messenger platforms to open their doors for application development on their chats and started the rise of these applications. We all know them today as chatbots.
<br /><br />
Chatbots are much more than a hype. They change the way we communicate with companies and are bringing customer support and personalization to a new level. But what does the technology behind look like?
<br /><br />
In this talk, I will show you all the tools it takes to build a chatbot in PHP. You will see what itâ€™s like developing and testing chatbots for multiple platforms and how NLP (Natural Language Processing) services can help you to understand the user.

## Why I Have Chosen This Topic?

The last year I have been doing quite some general talks about chatbots. I wanted to show people why this topic is so important right now and to give them great insights and examples from my experiences. People seemed to enjoy these talks, and I received excellent feedback. Still, I wasn't able to go into details about developing chatbots. I want to change this with this new talk.

## Who This Talk Is For

This talk is for developers! It will contain everything you need to know about chatbot development and will show you what technologies are involved in building them. We will look at each of them in detail and bring them together. `If you are a developer and interested in chatbots, then this talk is for you!`
