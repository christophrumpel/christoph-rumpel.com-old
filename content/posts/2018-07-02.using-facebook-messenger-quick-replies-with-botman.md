Within chatbot conversation, it is a good idea to provide users with possible reply options. In Facebook Messenger, these options are called `quick replies`. Quick replies are buttons that the user can click instead of writing a reply himself. After clicking, the other options will disappear and only the clicked button text, will stay in the chatbot as the user's reply.<br /><br />

Structured messages, like quick replies, help users orientate within a conversation and make them simpler and faster. There are lots of other types of structured messages in Facebook Messenger, but today we will concentrate on quick replies.

## Sending Quick Replies

In BotMan it is effortless to send quick replies. The default BotMan question object with buttons will result in quick reply options. This is how you can send them from within your botman route file.

```php
 $botman->hears('I want more', function (BotMan $bot) {
     $bot->reply(Question::create('Are you sure?')->addButtons([
         Button::create('Yes')->value('yes'),
         Button::create('No')->value('no'),
     ]));
 });
```

## Listening To Quick Replies

BotMan makes it easy for you to handle clicked buttons. You can listen to their `value`. Here is another example.

```php
 $botman->hears('I want more', function (BotMan $bot) {
     $bot->reply(Question::create('Are you sure?')->addButtons([
         Button::create('Yes')->value('yes'),
         Button::create('No')->value('no'),
     ]));
 });
 
 $botman->hears('yes', function (BotMan $bot) {
     $bot->reply('Awesome ðŸ¤˜');
 });
```

## Using Quick Replies In Conversations

Most of the times you ask the user something, it will be part of a conversation. This is when it is a better idea to use a conversation class instead of listening in your BotMan route file for replies. First, we create a conversation class.

```bash
php artisan botman:make:conversation QuickReplyConversation
```

We will listen again for the sentence "I want more", but now we start a conversation to handle everything else. Don't forget to import the conversation class namespace as well.

```php
$botman->hears('I want more', function (BotMan $bot) {
    $bot->startConversation(new QuickReplyConversation());
});
```

Then we ask our question and provide options for the replies.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Conversations;

use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Incoming\Answer;
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Outgoing\Question;
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Outgoing\Actions\Button;
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Conversations\Conversation;

class QuickReplyConversation extends Conversation
{
    /**
     * Start the conversation.
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function run()
    {
        $this->askAboutMore();
    }

    private function askAboutMore()
    {
        $question = Question::create('Are you sure?')->addButtons([
            Button::create('Yes')->value('yes'),
            Button::create('No')->value('no'),
        ]);

        $this->ask($question, function (Answer $answer) {
            if($answer->getValue() === 'yes') {
                $this->bot->reply('Awesome ðŸ¤˜');
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Ask For Location, Phone number, and Email with Quick Replies

Since Messenger Platform 2.3, quick replies also support `location`, `phone number`and `email`. This means that the chatbot can ask for one of these values from the user. Facebook has access to these values and can send them to the bot if the user wants to.
<br /><br />
### Email
Let's start with the email address. Instead of using the default `Button` class, we switch to the `QuickReplyButton`. On its instance, we can then set a type, `user_email` in this case.
```php
$question = Question::create('Great. Can you give me your email address?')
            ->addAction(QuickReplyButton::create('test')->type('user_email'));

$this->ask($question, function (Answer $answer) {
    $this->bot->reply('Thanks for your email: '. $answer->getValue());
});
```

This will result in this button with the user's email address. Through clicking it, the user sends it to the chatbot. You can then access the email address with `$answer->getValue()`.

### Phone

Asking for the phone number is very similar to the email quick reply. Only the type is changing.

```php
$question = Question::create('Great. Can you give me your phone number?')
            ->addAction(QuickReplyButton::create('test')->type('user_phone_number'));

$this->ask($question, function (Answer $answer) {
    $this->bot->reply('Thanks for your phone number: '. $answer->getValue());
});
```

Since I don't have my phone number connected to my Facebook account, I can't show you a screenshot of that. Important to know is, that if you don't have a phone number connected, the quick reply button will not be shown.

### Location

Since the last Facebok Messenger Platform update, we are also able to ask for the user's location. This is great when you need to provide information based on where the user is right now. Again, it is very similar to the other quick replies. The only differences are the type again and that we get access through the location object after the answer.

```php
$question = Question::create('Great. Can you give me your location?')
            ->addAction(QuickReplyButton::create('test')->type('location'));

$this->ask($question, function (Answer $answer) {
    $this->bot->reply('Latitude: '.$answer->getMessage()->getLocation()
            ->getLatitude().' Longitude: '.$answer->getMessage()->getLocation()->getLongitude());
});
```
