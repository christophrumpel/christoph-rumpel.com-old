title: Sending Laravel Notifications Via Twitter
categories: laravel, video
summary: My first and most used Laravel package is the Twitter Channel I made for Laravel Notifications. Today I released a new version of it, and I thought it is an excellent time to share a video about how to use it as well.

On the 21st of August in 2016, I made the first commit to my first Laravel package. It was the beginning of the [Laravel Twitter Channel](https://github.com/laravel-notification-channels/twitter) which I made for the [Laravel Notification Channels](http://laravel-notification-channels.com/) project.

Actually, at that time, I wanted to work on the Facebook Channel, but someone else already did. So I was asked if I could check if we can make one for Twitter as well. I said yes, and I'm glad I did. The Twitter Channel package is just a small package, but it was already downloaded over 12.000 times. So I would say it might be quite useful :-)

## The Purpose

The Twitter Channel allows you to send Laravel notifications through Twitter. To be concrete, you can:

* Send a notification as a Twitter Status Update in your timeline.
* Send a notification as a Twitter Direct Message to another user.

That's already it; handy but straightforward.

## Introduction

If you want to try it out, you will find all the information you need on the [repository](https://github.com/laravel-notification-channels/twitter) site. But next to that, I also recorded a video today. I made it to give you a more personal introduction to this package.

</div>

## Version 2.0

If you take a close look at the package, you will see that on the outside, not much has changed. The features are almost the same. But I did refactor the whole package and updated all the dependencies. I also had to rewrite the direct message feature due to some changes at Twitter.

With version 2.0, I also stop supporting Laravel 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5. It is time to move on, and you should update your applications. :-) This is also why this package now requires PHP >= 7.1.0.

If you still got any more questions, just contact me [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christophrumpel) or create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/laravel-notification-channels/twitter). Have fun!
