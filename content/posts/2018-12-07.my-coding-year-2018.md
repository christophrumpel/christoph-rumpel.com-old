## Resolutions from 2017

Here are my resolutions from 2017. I do not treat them as my main goals for a year, but I think it's good to start with a little plan or direction. It doesn't matter if not everything works out as planned. That's life :-)

* Find out how I want to work
* Find a job or create my own one
* Take the risk if there is a chance to make a dream come true
* Become a Laracon conference speaker

## Find Out How I Want To Work

The end of 2017 was also the end my last job. I needed a change and to try something new or at least different. Back then, I didn't knew what that was and where this could lead me. Pretty soon it was clear to me that I wanted to work from home. I wanted to decide myself how and when to work and this only works if I work remote.
