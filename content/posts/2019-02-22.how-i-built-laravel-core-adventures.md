title: How I Built Laravel Core Adventures
categories:
summary: Most interesting about a new product, except the product itself, are the little details and decisions that shaped it to what it became. This article is my approach to tell you all the problems, ideas, and solutions that created Laravel Core Adventures. It is not rocket science, but it is REAL.

## About

[Laravel Core Adventures](https://laravelcoreadventures.com) is a free video series where I teach about how Laravel works under the hook aka the core. The idea is to pick a Laravel topic like `Facades` and then make little videos to explain important aspects of this topic.

Right now, Laravel Core Adventures consists of two categories, eight videos and over an hour of content. But behind the scenes, I'm already working on the next category and videos.

## Tech Stack

The stack of this project is pretty simple and `boring`. I'm using:

* Laravel 5.7
* MySQL
* Vanilla JS
* Forge

The Laravel project consists of one layout file and two templates for the `welcome/overview` and the `detail` page. All the categories and video details are stored in the database and get updated over Laravel Seeder classes. This way I don't have to touch the tables itself.

The site needs a little bit of JavaScript for smooth scrolling and the category animations. (more about the animations later) There were at least ten times where I thought about using Vue.js, but in the end, I didn't. The goal for this project always was to keep it simple as long as possible and needed.

## Design

I always try to design such projects myself. And with `design` I mean finding something similar to what I want and copy it. I'm no designer at all, but still the visual appearance of what I build is critical to me.

### You Got A Friend

Since it is a free product, I also couldn't just hire a designer, and I was ok with that. I knew I could make the site look `ok` and keep the focus on the videos. Still, I was thinking about getting a logo, and so I asked a good friend of mine. He and his cousin have their own company called [complemind](http://complemind.com/), where they do all kind of graphic design projects.

So I told my friend about the idea of `Laravel Core Adventures` and connection to `Indiana Jones`. It should become more than a video platform. It should be about adventures and fun. He liked the idea and agreed to help me, but...

It was a big BUT! He and his cousin would help me, but they wanted to do more than just a logo. They wanted more illustrations, maybe a character and all in a style of their choice. So they had the opportunity to try out something new, and in return, I would get their help. Of course, I said yes :-)

### The Micro Site

It all started with this landing page example I found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4178092-Header-Underwater-World). I wanted the micro-site to look as clean and exciting as that.

While I was working on the application and the overall design of the website, these were the logos that we started with.

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot of the first two logos" src="/images/blog/lca_logos.png" />

1. The left already looked great, except for the color. Just black wasn't an option for me.
2. We released the site with the second logo from the image above. It looks much more alive, and the connection to Indiana Jones is perfect.

Now that we had the logo, I started thinking about other colors for the site. Since the logo was already very colorful, it wasn't too easy to find a highlight color for the website. (button, links etc.) In tht end I went for a teal, similar to the one on the right.

The content of the site was an easy decision:

* Section 1: short info + call to action = newsletter
* Section 2: more info
* Section 3: example videos
* Section 4: info about myself

### Full Site

After receiving great feedback for the release of the microsite, I already knew I had to work on a full site now. People were interested in this kind of videos, and the concept seemed to be a good one.

The full site should provide:

* sections for different categories
* lists of the videos
* a detail page for watching a video
* an option for donations
* an illustration in addition to the logo

The new header is my absolute favorite section. The designers did great work with the new illustration, and I still love how simple this first part of the website is.

It was hard for me to remove the newsletter form from this part because it was working so good. Still, I learned from the book I'm currently reading (Company of One by Paul Jarvis) that it is more important to serve the given users. Getting an email is one of the main priorities when you have a micro-site where you check people's interest in an idea. But now with the full site, the priority of a user is to start a journey and watch a video. So I moved the newsletter form down beneath the categories.

I had the hardest time with the layout of the category section. It took me endless hours and lots of discussions with designer friends to come up with this current solution. Beneath is a screenshot from an older version where I was using collapsable lists for the categories and the current one.

And last but not least, there is the detail section. The biggest problem here was that I don't have a typical logo or navbar on the welcome site, which I could use here as well. This is why we decided to create a horizontal text logo as well. Here I also got a comparison of an older design of this site and the current one.

## Videos

Laravel Core Adventures would be nothing without the little videos where I speak to you. So here is my current workflow for creating them.

### Research

First I decide on the next category. I already got a list of things I want to cover, but no order. I pick what interests me the most at that moment. Then I'll start my research. Most of the things I include are entirely new to me as well. I've seen most of the files and methods, but I never took the time to put all the dots together. And let's be honest, Laravel is a complex application like every framework is.

While my research I take pieces of code from the current topic and I try to follow what is happening. I also read a lot about those topics, if I find good articles. I have to admit there are not many of them for what I need. On the other hand, this means I'm providing something new and hopefully useful.

### The Plan
After my research, I hopefully have a good overall understanding of what is happening. Now the hardest part starts: Thinking about a way to teach what I have learned.

<blockquote>Teaching isn't just about providing information about a subject; it is about finding the right approach of explaining to reach a listener and help him.</blockquote>

My goal is to create an example that helps to understand what I try to teach. Then, of course, everything needs to be split up in small and easy to consume videos. When I have a plan for this, I start recording.

### Recording

Here the most challenging part is to find the correct words. It should sound professional, but still easy to understand and without useless buzzwords. And of course, you should speak loud, clear and fluently; of course not in your mother language :-)

After recording, editing starts. In my case, I still need to edit a lot. I hope this will get better with every new video. Then I need to upload the videos to Youtube, create preview images, add inspiring titles and descriptions and update the website of course. In the end, it adds up to a lot of work.

* Research: `one week`
* The plan for the videos: `three days`
* Recording: `two days`
* Editing: `one day`
* Uploading, images, text, release...: `one day`
