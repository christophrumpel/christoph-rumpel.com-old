## Table Of Content

* [Define Which Resources to Show on the Index View](#show_on_index_view)
* [Remove Links From Relational Fields](#remove_links)
* [Hide Resource From Navigation](#hide_from_navigation)

I will add more and more tips as I discover them.

## Define Which Resources to Show on the Index View

The index view is where you can see all the items of the chosen resource. In the example below, you can see all my recipes.

But sometimes you do not want to show all of them to the user. In my example, I only want to list recipes from a specific category.

Luckily, there is an easy way to define what to show on the index list. Every resource extends the base `Resource` class. In there, you can find the `indexQuery` method. 

```php
// Inside /app/Nova/Resource.php
public static function indexQuery(NovaRequest $request, $query)
{
    return $query;
}
```

You can copy this method to your own resource class and override it. Here is what I have used only to show breakfast recipes.

```php
// Inside /app/Nova/Recipe.php
public static function indexQuery(NovaRequest $request, $query)
{
    return $query->where('category_id', 1);
}
```

Just customize this query to only show what you like on the index list.

## Remove Links From Relational Fields

By default, relational fields provide a link to the related item. So when you click `dinner` from my example, you will get to the category item `dinner`.

This is a cool feature, but not always what you want. For example, if you don't want to show categories as a resource, it makes sense to skip the link as well. In earlier versions of Nova, I needed to override the Vue component to remove the link. I'm glad there was a method added called `viewable`. 

```php
// Inside /app/Nova/Recipe.php
public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        ID::make()->sortable(),
        BelongsTo::make('Category', 'category', Category::class)
            ->viewable(false),
        Text::make('name')
    ];
}
````

Inside my recipe resource class, I can set the category field viewable to `false`. This will remove the link. Now, our category field is just plain text.

## Hide Resource From Navigation

Since we don't want to link our recipes to their belonging category, it makes sense to also hide the category recourse from the navigation. This can be done by overriding the `$displayInNavigation` property in the recipe resource.

```php
// Inside /app/Nova/Recipe.php
/**
 * @var bool 
 */
public static $displayInNavigation = false;
````

Now, we don't see the category resource listed in the navigation anymore.
