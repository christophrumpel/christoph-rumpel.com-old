##Define which resources to show in the index view

The index view shows all of your items from the chosen Nova resource. Here you can see an example of all my recipes.

But sometimes you do not want to show all of them to the user. In my example, I only want to list recipes with a specific category.

Luckily, there is an easy way to define what to show on the index list. Every resource extends the base `Resource` class. In there, you can the find the `indexQuery` method. 

```php
public static function indexQuery(NovaRequest $request, $query)
{
	return $query;
}
```

You can just copy this method to your own resource class and override it. Here is what I have used to only show breakfast recipes.

```php
public static function indexQuery(NovaRequest $request, $query)
{
	return $query->where('category_id', 1);
}
```

Just customize this query to only show what you like on the index list.
