title: The €963 Book Launch That Made Me Wish To Get Back To My Secured Job
categories:
summary: Exactly 365 days ago, I released my first ebook. I always wanted to share my experiences about it, but I never felt comfortable enough to do so. The project didn't turn out as expected and I felt embarrassed. It's time to reflect this project and face my fears.

This is the tweet I posted a year ago to present my first product [Build Chatbots with PHP](https://store.christoph-rumpel.com/).

It is always special when you release something to the world, especially when you put so much time and effort into it. You think about `what if`. What if everybody buys it and you can make a lot of money? What if people love it so much, they want you to write a second or third one too? ARe going to be an author for the rest of your life? What if this could be the start of something very big an special for your future?

Today, on this first anniversary, I want to provide you my review on the whole project today and share the `What if you fall short of your own expectations?`.

## Numbers

- Sold copies first three days: 26
- Sold copies first year: 78
- Made revenue: €2940
- Invested time: ~450h
- Invested money: €1221
	- €200 Logo
	- €447 Editing/Proof Read
	- €40 Facebook Ads
	- €480 Podia (Hosting)
	- €54 Leanpub (Hosting)


If I would have worked the same time for €7/h, I would have made more money. So financially speaking, the project wasn't a success at all. I have to say making money wasn't my first priority. Still, my minimum goals was to sell at least 150 copies in the first year. I didn't achieve this goal.

A year before I released my book, Adam Wathan published [Refactoring to Collection](https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/).
