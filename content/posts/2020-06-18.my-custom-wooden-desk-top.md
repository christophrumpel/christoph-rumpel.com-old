title: My Custom Wooden Desk Top
categories: Setup
summary: In 2019, I moved to a new place and got my first own office room. This also meant I could finally get a new desk I was desperately looking forward to. Since I couldn't find a wooden top that fits my room, I decided to try to build one myself. Here comes my two left hands! ðŸ¤šðŸ¤š

After a month of hard work, sweat, tears, and a dozen of times when I wanted to quit, I finished my first wooden project. I really enjoy working with wood, and I hope I find some more projects soon. If you're interested in my full setup, take a look at my [uses page](/uses).
