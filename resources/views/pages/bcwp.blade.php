            <p>In 2018, I released my first book called <code>Build Chatbots with PHP</code>. You can read all about the launch <a class="text-link" href="/2018/02/my-build-chatbots-with-php-book">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, already the year after it was outdated and I had to take it down. Sales weren't too good, so it made no sense for me to update it.
                <a href="/2019/07/the-book-launch-that-made-want-my-old-job-back">Here</a> is an article where I share all the numbers of my first product.</p>
            <p>Still, there are a lot of articles about building chatbots on my blog. Please give them <a href="/category/chatbots">a look</a> if this is what you are interested in.</p>
