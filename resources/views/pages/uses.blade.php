            <h2>This Is My Current Dev Setup</h2>

            <h3>Hardware</h3>

            <h4>Laptop</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016)</li>
                <li>3.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7</li>
                <li>6 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3</li>
                <li>It still works quit good but gets sometimes slow</li>
                <li>I will probably soon look for a new one</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mouse / Keyboard</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Apple Bluetooth Keyboard</li>
                <li>Apple Magic Mouse 2</li>
                <li>I'm at a point where I don't wanna see any cables on my desk :-)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Laptop Stand</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Griffin Elevator</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Display</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LG UltraFine 5K Display</li>
                <li>It gets charged through the USB-Ca connection</li>
                <li>I was looking for a cheaper option but none of them had a beautiful clean design</li>
                <li>I didn't regret it</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Microphone</h4>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_mic.jpg') }}" alt="Hyper microphone">
            <ul>
                <li>HyperX QuadCast - USB Condenser Gaming Microphone</li>
                <li>Blue Compass microphone arm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I was using an AKG Perception 220 professional studio microphone before, which I had at home since I was recording music. This was pretty good and I used it with an extra audio interface. Unfortunately, lately I had troubles with the audio quality and noise. I couldn't tell when and where it came from so I deciced to give an USB microphone a try. It came with a beautiful desk stand which I loved. The HyperX Quadcast is a good microphone but you cannot compare it to my old one. I had to put up a lot of acoustic foam in my office to make the sound ok. I also had to use the microphone arm, because with the HyperX desk stand you are too far away from the microphone. Now, with the right setup, I enjoy this new microphone and it was quite cheap compared to professional ones.
            </p>
            <h4>Light</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Elgato Key Light Air</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I do quite some video calls and now also more online conferences and so I decided to level up my video quality. Light is an important factor of that and so I bought the Elgato Key Light Air. I first had the bigger Elgato key Light which is also more powerful. The downside is it comes only with a mounting system which didn't fit my desk. So I switched to the smaller Light version which is also more beautiful. I like it a lot.</p>

            <h4>Desk Frame</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully Jarvis Frame Only</li>
                <li>DIY adjustable height</li>
                <li>Save different height settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since I spent so much time sitting in front of a computer, a standing desk was on my list for a long time now. Since I moved last year, I finally had the chance and place to get one. I did a lot of research and I'm super happy with my choice. For me it was important that I only get the frame so that I can use a custom top.</p>

            <h4>Desk Top</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Custom Top</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I needed a custom top for my desk so that I would fit a niche in my office room. I didn't find one to buy so I decided to give it a try myself. I had like no experiences with wood working so far, so I watched a lot of youtube videos and also talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/gonedark">Jason McCreary</a> who is more experienced. I could write a whole article just about this one month project, but in short, I managed to build and paint a custom top for myself. It is not perfect, but I'm still pretty proud.</p>
