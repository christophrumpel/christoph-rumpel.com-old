            <h1>Uses</h1>

            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_table.jpg') }}" alt="Christoph's working desk">

            <p>This is my current development setup which includes all the hard- and software I need for my daily work
                as a web developer and content creator.</p>

            <h2>Hardware</h2>

            <h3>Laptop</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016)</li>
                <li>3.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7</li>
                <li>6 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3</li>
                <li>It still works quite good but gets slow sometimes</li>
                <li>I will probably soon look for a new one</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mouse / Keyboard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Apple Bluetooth Keyboard</li>
                <li>Apple Magic Mouse 2</li>
                <li>I'm at a point where I don't want to see any cables on my desk :-)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Laptop Stand</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Griffin Elevator</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Display</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>LG UltraFine 5K Display</li>
                <li>It gets charged through the USB-Ca connection</li>
                <li>I was looking for a cheaper option, but none of them had a beautiful clean design</li>
                <li>I didn't regret it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Microphone</h3>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/pages/uses_mic.jpg') }}" alt="Hyper microphone">
            <ul>
                <li>HyperX QuadCast - USB Condenser Gaming Microphone</li>
                <li>Blue Compass microphone arm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I used an AKG Perception 220 professional studio microphone before, which I had at home since I was
                recording music. This was pretty good, and I used it with an additional audio interface. Unfortunately,
                lately, I had trouble with the audio quality and noise. I couldn't tell when and where it came from, so
                I decided to give a USB microphone a try. It came with a beautiful desk stand which I loved. The HyperX
                Quadcast is an excellent microphone, but you cannot compare it to my old one. I had to put up a lot of
                acoustic foam in my office to make the sound ok. I also had to use the microphone arm because with the
                HyperX desk stand, you are too far away from the microphone. With the right setup, I enjoy this new
                microphone, and it was quite cheap compared to professional ones.</p>
            <h3>Light</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Elgato Key Light Air</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I do quite some video calls and now also more online conferences and so I decided to level up my video
                quality. Light is an essential factor of that, and so I bought the Elgato Key Light Air. I first had the
                more significant Elgato key Light, which is also more powerful. The downside is it comes only with a
                mounting system which didn't fit my desk. So I switched to the smaller Light version, which is also more
                beautiful. I like it a lot.</p>

            <h3>Desk Frame</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully Jarvis Frame Only</li>
                <li>DIY adjustable height</li>
                <li>Save different height settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since I spent so much time sitting in front of a computer, a standing desk was on my list for a long
                time. Since I moved last year, I finally had the chance and place to get one. I did a lot of research,
                and I'm super happy with my choice. For me, it was important that I only get the frame so that I can use
                a custom top.</p>

            <h3>Desk Top</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Custom Top</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I needed a custom top for my desk to fit a niche in my office room. I didn't find one to buy, so I
                decided to give it a try myself. I had no experience with woodworking so far, so I watched a lot of
                youtube videos and talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/gonedark">Jason
                    McCreary</a>, who is more experienced with that kind of work. In <a
                    href="/2020/6/my-custom-wooden-desk-top">this post</a>, I share some images of the process building
                the desk top.

            <h3>Chair</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Secretlab OMEGA</li>
                <li>Charcoal Blue SoftWeaveÂ® Fabric</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During the cyber week in December 2019, there was a good deal for this chair. I wasn't sure if I should
                try a gaming chair, but I'm pretty satisfied. Especially the pillows for your head and back are
                comfortable and support your body.</p>
